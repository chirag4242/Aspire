# Aspire - Capstone project : Asp.Net MVC Full Stack Application

This project involved the development and implementation of a full-stack web application using Asp.Net MVC, C# (Object Oriented Programming), MSSQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Entity Framework Core. The aim of the project was to provide automation with database, fast user experience, and real-time collaboration.

Working with an agile team of three, we followed agile methodology and the SDLC to ensure the timely and successful completion of the web application. The collaboration enabled us to exchange ideas and come up with a robust application that met the client's needs.

One of the critical features of the web application was the implementation of robust authentication and authorization protocols. This ensured that the interactive database was highly secure, protecting user data from unauthorized access.

As a software developer, I played a crucial role in the project, analyzing and solving complex problems with git, unit testing, and selenium. We used these tools to ensure that the application was working correctly, free from errors and met the client's requirements.

In summary, the project involved the development of a full-stack web application that was fast, secure, and easy to use. Working with an agile team, we delivered a high-quality application that met the client's needs.

## Installation

Easy and simple way configure the application is in Visual Studio. 
- The first step is to setup a Visual Studio application with SQL server connection string by configuring the system to run the app. 

- To create and access the data, we need an database to do that we need to use `Add-Database / Update-Database` with `dbContext` file. 

- Run following commands to setup database
```package manager
  Update-Database context AuthContext 
  Update-Database context AppDbContext
```
- After that if there is no error, run the application in Visual Studio.
